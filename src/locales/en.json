        "main": "Hey! First of all, thanks for activating me!\n\nHave you ever had a moments when you see a trailer of cool movie and give yourself a promise to watch it? Then it appears to be 2 or 3 months until the release of this movie and you simply forget about it..\n\nMy author was in such situation quite a lot of time. And that's exactly why he created me. My name is Eve and I help him to track any movies he wants - as soon as they're available on torrents, I'm sending him a message about it and he never forgets to watch them anymore. I can help you with it as well! Just go search for a movie and add it to your collection and I'll write you back once you can watch it!
